# Historical Analysis 

## Project Proposal - Economics Data 

### Project Title - The Rhymes of History

In this project we look into historical data and store that data to study whether they can determine any patterns across numerous economic indicators. This provides the best chance to be positioned well going into turbulent economic conditions and assist with business decisions moving forward.

We look into the different data involving Analysis of Government Debt, Inflation Rate and Foreign Direct Investment

### Research Questions to Answer 

1. Identify any relationships between Government Debt, Inflation Rate and Foreign Direct Investment

2. Using the data available, model any relationships visually
